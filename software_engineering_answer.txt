Question:
What do you mean by engineering and how is it different from software engineering?
As we know there are certain steps involved in the software development life cycle
of different models like Waterfall, Spiral, RAD and Prototype.
Suggest a new software development life cycle other than these.

Answer:

Engineering is the process of planning, designing, building, and improving solutions
in a disciplined and systematic manner to solve real-world problems.

Software Engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the systematic
development, operation, and maintenance of software using engineering principles,
tools, and methodologies.

Difference between Engineering and Software Engineering:
Engineering focuses on physical systems and products, whereas software engineering
deals with software products and uses code, logic, and algorithms.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to develop
high-quality software. Some commonly used SDLC models include Waterfall, RAD,
Spiral, and Prototyping. Each model has its own advantages and limitations.

Apart from Waterfall, RAD, Spiral, and Prototyping, a widely used modern SDLC
model is the DevOps Model.

DevOps is a modern SDLC approach that integrates development (Dev) and operations
(Ops) to enable continuous development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

The main goal of the DevOps model is to reduce development time and increase
software reliability through automation and collaboration.
